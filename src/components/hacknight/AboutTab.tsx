        The TWD Hack Night is a monthly event where we come together to work on
        projects, learn new things, and share our knowledge with others. It's a
        great opportunity to meet new people, work on something you're
        passionate about, and learn from others.
      </p>
      <p>
        We welcome people of all skill levels and backgrounds. Whether you're a
        seasoned developer or just starting out, there's something for everyone
        at the TWD Hack Night.
